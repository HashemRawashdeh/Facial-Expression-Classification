# Facial Expression Classification
The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate facial expression classification system by leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This system will have broad applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, mental health analysis, and market research, contributing to enhanced user experiences, improved mental health diagnostics, and data-driven business decisions. To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the system, rigorous evaluation will be conducted using various performance metrics, allowing for benchmarking and comparison with existing methods in facial expression recognition.
